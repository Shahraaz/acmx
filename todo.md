# TODO

* Go over the Roadmap.md and convert in TODO
* When a new view is activated (after run or view:code) close all open tabs. (also (maybe) collapse everything not related to the problem)

* [005](/src/core.ts): Restrict brute in time, and capture errors
  * Allow stopping a running program (such as sol.cpp/brute.cpp/gen.py/etc...)
* [007](/src/extension.ts): How can I have access to new process created using `openFolder`?
* Add gif to README. Gif should be a tutorial (how to use).

* Change icon
* Add better instructions
* Find is there is a better way to handle the structure of all the solutions.
